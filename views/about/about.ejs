                    The name's Jeff! I'm 24 years old, and I live in upstate New York. I served in the us army for 5 years as a blackhawk helicopter mechanic and started web development as 
                    a hobby during that time. I am currently in school persuing my degree in software engineering at embry-riddle aeronautical university. I have 
                    always had an infactuation with computers and programming. I hope to continue devloping for as long as possible. I am continuously learning and reaserching new methods and strategies
                    for development to ensure you get the exquisite site that you are hoping for.
